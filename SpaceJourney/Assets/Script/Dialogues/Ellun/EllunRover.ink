Thank God there's someone who can I ask for help.
I can't found the 2 rovers on my vicinity.
Can you find them? There are white big machine that can help human to find and discover something new.
My team and I can't travel away from the base.
The team need to stay on the base.
In exchange I will tell you there's a missing treasure in Mercury.
But you need to find them and be careful the time there is short. 
It is known that there's only 88 days there.
So goodluck finding my rovers and the treasure.
