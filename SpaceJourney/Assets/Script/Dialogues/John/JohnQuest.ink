Ow what do you need?
Ow I think you are newbie and some scientist tell you about me.
By the way. I am John. I am one of the scientist here.
I think you are here for the record about the building.
I will give the record to you. I suggest to visit the 3 area.
Promise you will never get bored in the area.
One is the Observatory. Second will be the Upgrade and Trade Room.
Last but not the least is the Spaceship Take Off and Landing Area.
Have a good time finding them.
