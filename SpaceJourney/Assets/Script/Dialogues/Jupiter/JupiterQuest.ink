Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets 
in the Solar System combined, while being slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. 
Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, 
and it has been observed since prehistoric times. 
It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
Did you know Jupiter is saving the Earth?
Jupiter has been called the vacuum cleaner of the solar system 
because its gravity sucks in asteroids and comets, protecting us from those objects.
Now let's protect it to some asteroid.
