Ow! Are you new here? I am not familiar with your face.
By the way, I am Mark. A spacecraft engineer.
You are in the spaceship landing and take off.
For take off, you can talk to Chris the one who are near in the spacecraft.
He can help you to have a take off to the other planet.
But after that you need to fly the spaceship on your own.
That's it. Careful and Goodluck to the outer space.
