Scene 1

Youth has no age. So as a dream for starting to aspire to inspire before it expires. Everything started as nothing. As a kid growing up, the dream of the boy named "Astro" was explicit. His imagination for building yourself up to stand out and be recognized in a crowd was perpetual.

Scene 2

Unresting for the dream to reach someday, he started to cherish his visions and persistent dreams, as they are the igniting spirit of his soul, the blueprints of his ultimate achievements.

Scene 3 

These dreams are often at odds with his realities, demanding freedoms, and resources he may not have. In pursuit of his dreams, his perspective of it left him unwavering that this doesn't make it impossible to achieve. His efforts back then always reminded him that every obstacle he encounters are great opportunities.

Scene 4 

His passion to apply in the program proves him to step forward, striving to grow, and be worthy of that recognition. The sound of his computer keyboard is clacking, indeed time is ticking, as he thinks while typing. He thinks of upgrading the definition of his very own conviction. He wanted it to happen, wishing it to make it happen, he pondered repeatedly. Why not make it happen?

Scene 5

Dreams are illustrations from the book your soul is writing about you. You have to dream before your dreams can come true. He couldn't stop the feeling of glee that's radiating all over him. He thinks the word impossible is not in his dictionary at all. It always seems impossible but just wait until it's done.
...and his Space Journey beginsâ€¦
